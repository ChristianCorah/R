# This analysis is for a popular TikToker. It examines data within her control
# that she could potentially use to get more views. This variables include
# time posted, length of video, and whether or not the video is posted within
# an hour of another. The main dependent variable is "Total_Success_Score". It
# is a weighted combination of views, likes, comments, and shares.
